# R-Ladies Collaborations

R-Ladies around the world often work with organizations, ONGs, and other groups, producing contributions, participation, involvement or associations of talks, workshops, projects, conference, etc. And they directly impact the R community.

## Goals
This repository aims to document all of these collaborations. There are three main goals for this repository:
1. This repository aims to capture these R-Ladies collaborations in a single portfolio.
1. R-Ladies chapters can use this information to introduce R-Ladies and its work.
1. Readers and other people can see what we do and how we work with our R and non-R communities.

## What are Collaborations?
Collaborations and contributions can be a wide range of activities.
- They can be conferences, events or datathons organized by one or more chapters.
- A data analysis for an organization made by an R-Ladies chapter. This does not have to be necessarily open to the whole chapter: it can be done by a group of R-Ladies members, it can have a confidentiality arrangement, and so on.
- Workshops or training-sessions co-organized with other groups, or open to enterprises and/or organizations members.
- Events in which foreign speakers (i.e. non-local) were proposed by an R-Ladies chapter, but an organization helped to bring them in-person to the meeting.

## Submit Your Collaboration
To submit a new contribution, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the zip file to your computer.
1. Copy the [template](/resources/template.Rmd) and name it `ChapterCity-Organization.Rmd`. Use your chapter name (`ChapterCity`) and the organization's name on the title (`Organization`).
1. Locate the file in the corresponding folder. This should be at: `contributions -> year`, where `year` is the year in which the collaboration took part.
    - If several R-Ladies chapters contributed to the same event, you can: (a) put the name of a geographic region, or (b) list their names if they are not more than three chapters (e.g. `ChapterCity1-ChapterCity2-ChapterCity3-Organization.Rmd`).
    - If your collaboration/event started in one year, and ended on the next one, please upload _in the starting year folder_.   
1. Once your file is ready, make a Pull Request (PR) for the RMarkdown file. Available curators will review your submission, and make any suggestion if neccesary.
    - If there are revisions to make, you will have to update the PR, until approved.
    - Once the review is approved, _knit_ your RMarkdown file to create an `*.html` file, and make a new PR for the HTML file. This will be instantly approved.
